# Intention
This folder is very personal and would highly depend on the user. I would recommend keeping a `./personal` subfolder though.

# Subfolders
![./keepass](./keepass) => For keepass related files for password management (might be changed) 
![./learning](./learning) => For learning related documents
![./learning/school](./learning/school) => For school documents, such as *tests, class essays, and other documents* (separated by course)
![./learning/personal](./learning/personal) => For courses not taken in school
![./personal](./personal) => For personal documents, such as stuff that will be included on *your resume*.
Optionally, you can simply clone the entire original root file-tree (excluding archive)

# Examples
This can include things such as source code of deleted repositories.
