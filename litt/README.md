## Patterns

* Check https://bookbrainz.org for Proper Author/Title Naming
* Include ISBN (10 or 13) similar to Music Releases
* Example: J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone [English] {1408845644}
* ISBN-10 can be expanded to ISBN-13 by adding 978: {978-1408845646}

**Naming Ideas:**

	└── Lastname, Firstname
		└── Firstname Lastname - [Book Series #] - Book Title {ISBN}.ext

## Resources

There are several classification systems for libraries to sort and catalog books. (See Wikipedia Link on Library Classifications)
In this repository, we want to use such systems and provide examples on how they would be applied.
