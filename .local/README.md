# What is this for?

This is a very unix like way of organizing your files but I htink that it is particularly useful for home machines in general.

* `./src`
    * For your personal repositories
    * Directories where you run `git init`
    * e.g. `./src/file-tree`
* `./bin`
    * For binaries 
    * This directory is intended for production level binaries
* `./share`
    * For static data like database files
