# What is this for?

This is a very unix like way of organizing your files but I htink that it is particularly useful for home machines in general.

* `./src`
  * For your personal repositories
  * Directories where you run `git init`
  * e.g. `./src/file-tree`
* `./bin`
  * For binaries 
  * This directory is intended for production level binaries
* `./share`
  * For static data like database files
* `/state`
  * Used for storing the current state of programs on unix machines
